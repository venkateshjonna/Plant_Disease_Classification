🌿 Leaf Health Detection - CNN Model 🌱  
This project aims to detect whether a leaf is healthy or rusty by analyzing images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The model is trained to classify leaf images into two categories: Healthy 🍃 or Rusty 🍂. A Flask-based web application is also included, allowing users to upload leaf images and receive predictions along with the model structure and some extracted features.  


🚀 Features  
Image Classification 📷: Detects and classifies leaves as healthy or rusty.  
Flask Web App 🌐: Upload an image and get real-time predictions.  
Model Insights 🧠: View the CNN model structure and extracted features.  
User-Friendly Interface 👨‍💻: Easy to use with a clean and simple design.  


🔍 How It Works  
1.Model Training 🏋️‍♂️  
A CNN model is trained on a dataset of leaf images, categorized as healthy or rusty.  
The model is evaluated for accuracy, precision, and recall to ensure optimal performance.  
2.Flask Integration 🧩  
The trained model is integrated into a Flask application.  
Users can upload images of leaves through a simple web interface.  
3.Image Upload & Classification 🌿  
Upload an image of a leaf using the web app.  
The app processes the image and classifies it as either Healthy 🍃 or Rusty 🍂.  
The model structure and some extracted features are also displayed for deeper insights.  


🛠️ How to Run the Project  
1.Clone the Repository 📥  
git clone https://github.com/venkateshjonna/Plant_Disease_Classification.git  
cd leaf-health-detection  
2.Install Dependencies 🛠️  
pip install -r requirements.txt  
3.Run the Flask App 🚀  
python app.py  
4.Access the Web App 🌐  
Open your browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/  
Upload a leaf image and see the prediction!  


🧪 Example Outputs  
Healthy Leaf 🍃  
Model Prediction: Healthy  
Extracted Features: Color intensity, texture, etc.  
Rusty Leaf 🍂  
Model Prediction: Rusty  
Extracted Features: Rust spots, discoloration, etc.
